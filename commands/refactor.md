# /refactor â€” The Code Surgeon v3.0

$ARGUMENTS

---

## IRON RULE

> âš¡ Refactoring MUST NOT reduce performance.
> ONLY maintain or improve. Any regression â†’ ROLLBACK.

---

## GOLDEN RULES

```
1. PERFORMANCE IS SACRED â€” Never trade speed for readability
2. MEASURE BEFORE SURGERY â€” No refactor without metrics
3. LOGIC UNCHANGED â€” Only change STRUCTURE, not BEHAVIOR
4. MICRO-STEPS â€” 1 refactoring = 1 commit, test each step
5. BEFORE/AFTER â€” Compare metrics and performance
6. SAFETY FIRST â€” Backup, test baseline, rollback plan
```

---

## Phase 1: Auto-Scope + Mode Selection

```
1. Scan source code â†’ count files, functions, components
2. Run lint + build â†’ current health status
3. Read recent git log â†’ context

Report:
  "ðŸ”ª Found:
   [X] source files | [Y] functions
   [Z] lint warnings | Build: [pass/fail]

   Choose mode:"

MODES:
  A) âš¡ Quick Surgery (1 file)
  B) ðŸ” Deep Surgery (1 module)
  C) ðŸ¥ Full Body Scan (full project)
```

---

## Phase 2: Code Health X-Ray

```
MEASURE EVERYTHING before touching code:

| Metric | Current | Target | Tool |
|--------|:-------:|:------:|------|
| Complexity | [X] | < 10 | ESLint rule |
| Nesting depth | [X] | â‰¤ 3 | Manual |
| Lines/function | [X] | â‰¤ 25 | Manual |
| Lines/file | [X] | â‰¤ 300 | wc -l |
| Lint warnings | [X] | 0 | ESLint |
| Build status | [X] | Pass | npm build |

CODE HEALTH SCORE: [N]/100
  90-100: ðŸŸ¢ Healthy
  70-89:  ðŸŸ¡ Needs attention
  50-69:  ðŸŸ  Significant debt
  < 50:   ðŸ”´ Critical â€” refactor before features
```

---

## Phase 3: Code Smell Detection (Fowler's Catalog)

```
SCAN for 5 smell categories:

ðŸ˜ BLOATERS:
  â–¡ Long Method (> 25 lines)
  â–¡ Large Class (> 300 lines)
  â–¡ Long Parameter List (> 4 params)
  â–¡ Primitive Obsession

ðŸ”¨ OO ABUSERS:
  â–¡ Switch Statements (should be polymorphism?)
  â–¡ Temporary Field
  â–¡ Refused Bequest

ðŸš§ CHANGE PREVENTERS:
  â–¡ Divergent Change (1 class, many reasons to change)
  â–¡ Shotgun Surgery (1 change, many classes affected)

ðŸ—‘ï¸ DISPENSABLES:
  â–¡ Dead Code (unused functions/imports)
  â–¡ Duplicate Code (3+ occurrences)
  â–¡ Lazy Class (does almost nothing)
  â–¡ Comments explaining bad code

ðŸ”— COUPLERS:
  â–¡ Feature Envy (method uses other class more)
  â–¡ Inappropriate Intimacy (classes too intertwined)

Report per smell:
  "ðŸŸ SMELLS FOUND: [N] total
   ðŸ”´ Critical: [list]
   ðŸŸ¡ Should fix: [list]
   ðŸŸ¢ Minor: [list]"
```

---

## Phase 4: SOLID Principles Audit

```
| Principle | Score | Violations |
|-----------|:-----:|-----------|
| S - Single Responsibility | [/10] | [files doing 2+ things] |
| O - Open/Closed | [/10] | [needs modification to extend] |
| L - Liskov Substitution | [/10] | [subtype behavior breaks] |
| I - Interface Segregation | [/10] | [fat interfaces] |
| D - Dependency Inversion | [/10] | [hardcoded dependencies] |

SOLID SCORE: [/50]
```

---

## Phase 5: Safety Protocol (MANDATORY)

```
BEFORE any refactoring:

1. BRANCH: git checkout -b refactor/[scope]-[date]
2. TEST BASELINE: run tests â†’ record pass/fail count
3. PERFORMANCE BASELINE: measure execution time
4. LINT BASELINE: record warning count
5. ROLLBACK PLAN: git checkout main
6. COMMIT STRATEGY: 1 refactoring = 1 commit

âš ï¸ DO NOT proceed until 6/6 complete.
```

---

## Phase 6: Precision Surgery (Execution)

```
For EACH refactoring:

1. ANNOUNCE â€” what technique, which file
2. SHOW BEFORE â€” code before change
3. EXECUTE â€” apply Fowler technique
4. SHOW AFTER â€” code after change
5. EXPLAIN â€” why this improves health
6. VERIFY â€” tests pass? lint clean? build OK?
7. PERFORMANCE CHECK â€” benchmark â‰¥ baseline?
   IF slower â†’ ðŸ›‘ ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
8. COMMIT â€” git add + commit

TECHNIQUES (use official names):
  - Extract Method
  - Inline Method
  - Move Method
  - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
  - Introduce Parameter Object
  - Replace Magic Number with Constant
  - Extract Class
  - Replace Temp with Query
```

## Phase 7: Before/After Report

```markdown
## ðŸ”ª REFACTOR REPORT

### Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Health Score | [X] | [Y] | +[Z]% |
| Lint warnings | [X] | [Y] | -[Z] |
| Code smells | [X] | [Y] | -[Z] |
| SOLID score | [X/50] | [Y/50] | +[Z] |
| Performance | [X]ms | [Y]ms | [Z]% |

### Techniques Applied
| # | Technique | File | Impact |
|---|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | [name] | [file] | [improvement] |

### Verdict
ðŸ† [IMPROVED / MAINTAINED / NEEDS MORE WORK]

## Guard Rails

```
âš ï¸ REFACTOR â‰  REWRITE:
  Changing > 60% code â†’ STOP â†’ /architect first

âš ï¸ REFACTOR â‰  FEATURE:
  Adding new logic â†’ STOP â†’ /create instead

ðŸ”´ PERFORMANCE SACRED:
  Any slowdown â†’ ROLLBACK â†’ find another approach
```

---

## Next Steps

```
After /refactor, consider:
  â†’ /test â€” Verify no behavior changed (mandatory)
  â†’ /review health â€” Check improved code health score
  â†’ /save â€” Persist refactor decisions to .brain/
```
